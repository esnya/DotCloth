# DotCloth Godot Sample

Minimal Godot 4 project using DotCloth with all simulation content driven by scene nodes.
Each scenario is a `ClothNode` under the root and can be toggled on/off via the `ClothPanel` control.
Force models switch at runtime, and plane, sphere, and capsule colliders are regular nodes that feed the simulation.
