# DotCloth Godot Sample

Minimal Godot 4 project using DotCloth.
The scene contains a `Main` root node, a child `Cloth` node that wraps the simulation, and a `ClothPanel` control for runtime model and size changes with a performance readout.
A `PlaneCollider` keeps the cloth above the ground plane (Y=0).
