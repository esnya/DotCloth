Contributing Guide
==================

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Basics
- Discuss significant changes via issues before starting work.
- Keep PRs cohesive with clear intent and tests.
- Follow Conventional Commits + gitmoji in commit messages.

## Development
- .NET 9/8 SDK; nullable enabled; warnings as errors.
- Run: `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`. Build the sample if needed: `dotnet build examples/DotCloth.MonoGameSample` (GUI not required).

## Style & Safety
- Use clear names aligned with domain terms. Avoid speculative abstractions (YAGNI) and duplication (DRY).
- Avoid introducing third‑party code without explicit license review and attribution.

## Legal
- The terms “PBD/XPBD” are used descriptively for literature references.
- Do not include proprietary code or assets.
